# AiChemist

AiChemist is a collaborative platform for scientific research built with React and styled-components. This project serves as an interactive platform where users can view and edit experiments, providing a streamlined way for researchers and collaborators to work together and track their progress.

## Project Overview

The main features of AiChemist include:

- A list of all experiments, along with their investigator and descriptions.
- A detail page for each experiment, where you can see more information and update the details of the experiment.
- A collaboration page, where users can communicate with others and collaborate on experiments.
- A "featured" attribute for important experiments.
- Responsiveness for a variety of screen sizes.
